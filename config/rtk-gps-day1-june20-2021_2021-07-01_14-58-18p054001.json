    "description": "Automatically generated description for a calibration starting from deploy_index: /home/dsouthall/projects/beacon/beacon/config/rtk-gps-day1-june20-2021.json.  This config has updated hpol values based on a calibration that was performed.  Initial description: Measurements made on June 20th using NTrip corrected RTK GPS and UNAVCO P652 data.  The expected accuracy of this data is on the scale of cm.  The listed altitudes are in WGS-84 and are adjusted by adding a height of 5ft8in, (1.7272m) from the actual measurements to account for the offset from the GPS patch antenna positions and the antennas at the top.  This is NOT the positions of the antennas as installed after this date (though likely very close), but rather of the masts before they were disassembled.  Some of the masts may have shifted from when their data was taken.  Cable delays come from the 2019 october deployment measurements and are not altered by a chi squared caliration effort.",
