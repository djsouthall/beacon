I forgot my notebook so am taking notes in a text file.  

The first setup I tried uses:
NSBP-208+ 	FM Tank
SLP-90+ 	LP Filter
ZFPT-282-1.5A+ 	Bias-Tee
SHP-0+ HP 	Filter
ZFL-750+ 	Amplifier.  
From what I am seeing on the scope, the current amplifier is not saturating, 
but it is also not providing sufficient amplification to overcome the noise
floor of the spectrum analyzer.  Going to swap out for higher gain amplifier.   

Swapping amp for ZKL-1R5+, the signals on the scope did not seem to be saturating, but the
signal was out of range on the oscilloscope, so I added a VAT-10+ 10dB attenuator before the
amplifier.  

Final electronics chain for roof measurement:

NSBP-208+ 	FM Tank
SLP-90+ 	LP Filter
ZFPT-282-1.5A+ 	Bias-Tee
SHP-0+ HP 	Filter
VAT-10+		Attenuator
ZKL-1R5+ 	Amplifier

Taking a 5 min measurement with this configuration.
