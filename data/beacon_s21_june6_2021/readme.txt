This data was taken using various configurations of 2 Tx and 1 Rx beacon antenna.
Data taken on 6/8/2021 in an open quad at uchicago.  The antennas were transmitting and recieving in hpol configuration, approximately 3ft off of the ground, and seperated by 50ft.  The Tx antennas are essentially the BEACON tester board, attached to 2x2021 deployment tines.  The Rx antenna was antenna board 5, with the 2nd stage tester board applying 4.8 V supply bias.  Some reflections were observed in the signals.  All cables should be calibrated out.  The 2nd stage tester board was not calibrated out.
