#The below package of ROOT was built specifically for our purposes to support a recent build of python and ROOT.  It will load python 3.7.1.

#echo "ROOT/6.16.00 and Python 3.7.1 Loaded"
#Note that loading this module in a bashrc may cause issues if accessing midway2 with thinlinc.  The rcc guys couldn't really explain to me why, but I would recommend just loading it as you need it or finding a work around to a bashrc load.
